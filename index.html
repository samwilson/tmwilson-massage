    <p>I have practiced Swedish massage for eight years. I am originally
      from Fremantle, but in January of 2008 I journeyed to the <a
        href="http://www.esalen.org/esalenmassage/">Esalen Institute</a>
      in Northern California to undertake a professional certification
      program of massage. Esalen has been an internationally respected
      teaching centre for massage for many decades, and my training at
      Esalen was an in depth combination of anatomy and hands on
      learning. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Esalen massage is a style of massage that uses many of the
      techniques of Swedish massage, as well as long, full body
      integrating strokes, many rotations of the joints, and an emphasis
      on the quality of the presence of the therapist. <br>
    </p>
    <p> I have also completed three years of a four year Bachelor of
      Physiotherapy at Notre Dame University, Western Australia.&nbsp; <br>
